They are then shown a screen with 9 icons, a volume control, and a play audio button. When the user hits play, they listen to the word that’s spoken and then select the icon that represents that word. The user can play the audio as many times as they need. If the user needs to, they can increase the volume until they hear the word. After they click an icon, they hit submit and a new audio is loaded.

If they click Submit within two seconds after the tone plays, they get a point. A two second window is used to give the user time to react.
