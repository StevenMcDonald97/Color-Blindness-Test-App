               "Why would I need a hearing test? Some people may suspect that they have hearing loss. They have trouble hearing people talk to them when they are in a crowded room, or they have been told they raise the volume on the TV way too high. But not all people know that they have a problem. You may not realize that you have hearing loss, because it is often a gradual process. That is why it is important to have your ears checked when your doctor says you should, even if you think you’re fine."

               "Conductive hearing loss is when a hearing impairment is due to problems in the outer ear, middle ear, ear canal, eardrum, or the ossicles, which are the tiny bones in the middle ear. When the sound is not being conducted properly through the ear, conductive hearing loss occurs. Most cases of conductive hearing loss can be corrected medically or surgically. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), also referred to as nerve hearing loss, occurs when there is damage to either the auditory nerve or the cochlea, which is the inner ear. The hearing loss in SNHL is permanent, although it may be possible to treat it with hearing aids. Mixed heaing loss is when When conductive hearing loss and SNHL occur at the same time. Mixed hearing loss occurs when there is both damage to the outer or middle ear and damage to the inner ear.        Central hearing loss occurs when there are problems within the brain that interfere with the ability to interpret or understand sounds. This is the rarest type of hearing impairment and the hardest to treat."
