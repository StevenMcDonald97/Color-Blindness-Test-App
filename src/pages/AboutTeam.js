            I live in Chennai, TamilNadu and I'm driven by my passion to build
            and create something that will have an enduring impact on society. I
            believe that we are not remembered by the amount of money we have
            made but rather by the lives we have changed in the process.This
            website is a passion project of mine, developed with the aim of
            creating awareness and diagnosing color blindness and hearing
            problems among the people of India and my sincere thanks to NGO
            name, Hsueh Yen Neo, Steven McDonald and Joey Bruno for making this
            possible.

            I am a software engineer and a recent graduate of Cornell
            University, living in the Bay Area, California. I was drawn to this
            project by the chance to use my programming skills to help people
            and have a positive impact on the world.

            I am a Teaching Assistant for an online Digital Marketing class with
            Vanderbilt University, living in Nashville, Tennessee. I wanted to
            join the project in order to help people, by using my mixed skills
            of graphic design and web development to help assist in the
            designing of the website itself.

        <h2>How We Got Together</h2>
        <p>
          The internet is a place where anyone can meet anyone else from around
          the world. That was how our team formed, four people from different
          corners of the globe united by a common goal of making something for
          those in need. When we started we had no goal, just the knowledge that
          when people with good intentions come together, good things will
          happen and just like the internet brought us together, it has given us
          the chance to help people living in places that we may never visit. We
          decided to design a website and give it to an NGO, so that while
          conducting health camps across India, they can use it as web based
          tool for for diagnosing color blindness and hearing problems. From all
          four of us, this website is our small contribution to society.
